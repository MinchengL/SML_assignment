# SML_assignment

There are different types of models implemented in our project. 

To get the cleaned data:
- run the cleaning.py file. Two processed files will be generated.

To run each models:
- if to run the cleaned data on the models, it is needed to change the input file names in the corrsponding model files.
- if not to run the cleaned data on the models, just directly run the model.

The files whose name ends with "output" means that it will generate the prediction result file of the test data.
The files whose name without "output" means that it only produce a accuracy result of running the training data.
